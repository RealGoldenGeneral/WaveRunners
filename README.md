## Wave Runners
This project is the second milestone for  Wave Runners. This milestone consists of the wave generator for the game. The level generator generates waves based on the frequencies. These waves vary in height based on a randomizer that picks a different frequency in every wave. The waves are calculated by gradually rising the water height in a certain area to match the height of the wave. This height is stored as a float in a sample. The wave also gradually decreases in height after reaching it's crest. The imcrementation increase exponentially with every bar. The waves moving gives the effect of the stage moving.
