## Wave Runners
This project is a prototype of the FFT level generation on  Unity that will be used for the game.This prototype is a simple implementation of FFT with 512 samples with a simple visualizer. The visualizer consists of just a single cube scaled up based on the values of the sample it represents.

### Parameters
Using Unity Editor, you can modify the scale of the waves generated by the FFT. You can also modify the amount of samples the FFT takes. Finally, you can replace the test audio with one of your own by importing the audio from your file.

In the audio source of the Scene, you  can modify the number of samples in the Fast Fourier Transform script to change the frequency of the waves and modify the sound playing from the source. In the Instantiate Cubes object, you can modify the scale of the waves to modify the amplitude.
